# clj-async.nvim

Provides async clojure completion for:

* [deoplete.nvim][]
* [ncm2][]
* [asyncomplete.vim][]
* [coc.nvim][]
* [nvim-cmp][]

Trying to use Fireplace's omnicompletion with auto-complete is painfully
slow at times, making typing blocked. Using this module will be faster as
it does not block, it runs in it's own thread.

## Installation

### CIDER

For this plugin to work, your nREPL must have CIDER available. You can install it for [lein](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl#via-leiningen) and [boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/Cider-REPL).

### Deoplete

Follow the install instructions for [deoplete.nvim][]. Then just include with
your favourite plugin manager, mine is [vim-plug][]

```vim
Plug 'clojure-vim/async-clj-omni'
```

You also need to include the following line in your init.vim:

```vim
call deoplete#custom#option('keyword_patterns', {'clojure': '[\w!$%&*+/:<=>?@\^_~\-\.#]*'})
```

### Nvim Completion Manager 2

1. Follow the install instructions for [ncm2][].
2. Add this plugin using your favourite plugin manager,
   ```vim
   Plug 'clojure-vim/async-clj-omni'
   ```

### asyncomplete.vim

Registration:

```
au User asyncomplete_setup call asyncomplete#register_source({
    \ 'name': 'async_clj_omni',
    \ 'whitelist': ['clojure'],
    \ 'completor': function('async_clj_omni#sources#complete'),
    \ })
```

### coc.nvim

1. Follow the install instructions for [coc.nvim][].
2. Add this plugin using your favourite plugin manager,
   ```vim
   Plug 'clojure-vim/async-clj-omni'
   ```

### nvim-cmp

1. Follow the install instructions for [nvim-cmp][].
2. Add `{ name = 'async_clj_omni' }`, a complete example:
   ```lua
   cmp.setup({
     sources = {
       { name = 'async_clj_omni' },
     }
   })
   ```

## Developing

### Deoplete
A few snippets and tidbits for development:

```vimscript
:call deoplete#custom#set('async_clj', 'debug_enabled', 1)
:call deoplete#enable_logging("DEBUG", "/tmp/deopletelog")
```

Then you can this command to watch debug statements:
```bash
$ tail -f /tmp/deopletelog
```

Debug statements can be made in the source via:
```python
self.debug(msg)
```

### Nvim Completion Manager

```
NVIM_PYTHON_LOG_FILE=logfile NVIM_PYTHON_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG nvim
```

## FAQ

1. Why do you include [nrepl-python-client][] via submodule.

   I made the decision that it was more complex to have users try and manage a
   version of [nrepl-python-client][], than it was for them to "just" have it
   included. In an ideal world, I'd be able to use virtualenv with the
   Python/Neovim, but this isn't currently a realistic expectation for all
   users to be able to use.
